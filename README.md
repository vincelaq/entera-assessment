# Entera Assessment

## By: Vincent Laquindanum

Hi, Stephen! These are my results for the Entera Junior Engineer Assessment completed on Friday, January 21, 2022. I tried to keep the code as strictly close to the instructions as possible: create an HTML page, render image, title of the art piece, and name of artist. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns at laq.vince@gmail.com.
